## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degredation and service workers are related due to the nature of their implementation. Both graceful degredation and 
service workers aim tto keep websites running even under poor circumstances. Graceful degredation is a design strategy where a website
is built with full functionality for newer/modern browsers, and still provides a good user experience even when some aspects of the 
website fail. This is where service workers come in, as they also work to keep the website up when there is no internet connection. 
Service workers help to keep the website content full through caching, which aligns with the implementation idea of graceful degredation. 
Therefore, since they both work together to keep the website up and running under less than ideal conditions, they are related.
